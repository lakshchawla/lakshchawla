# 👋 Hi, I'm Lakshay Chawla (aka Lakshh)

🎓 I'm a Master's student in **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** at **National Taipei University of Technology**, originally from India.  
⚙️ I'm passionate about **robotics simulation**, **AI research**, and building tools that bridge the gap between simulation and real-world autonomy.  
💡 My work blends **Isaac Sim**, **ROS 2**, **deep learning**, and **SLAM** — building smart, perception-driven robots from the ground up.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Building **open-source boilerplates for Isaac Sim Action Graphs** under my personal label [LaxLabs](https://github.com/lakshchawla)
- Researching **Visual SLAM**, **LiDAR-Inertial Odometry**, and **Perception Stacks** for AMRs
- Designing **multi-sensor robotic systems** in simulation to prototype real-world autonomy
- Exploring **Graph Neural Networks** for 3D point cloud analysis and scene understanding

## 🧠 Experience Highlights

- **Isaac Sim + ROS2 Researcher** at Intelligent Control Lab, NTUT  
  → Built Digital Twins, simulated SLAM tasks, and designed drone behavior models with RL & DL

- **Visual SLAM & 3D Scene Understanding** at Yuan Ze University  
  → Worked on ORB-SLAM3, RAG pipelines for LLMs in robotics, and GNN-based point cloud models

- **Computer Vision Researcher** for Satellite Imagery at Kalpana Chawla Center, CU  
  → Applied deep learning for image super-resolution and segmentation in space data

### 🌱 Philosophy

> "I don't come from privilege or a famous college. I come from persistence, from code that runs at 3AM, and from a dream that doesn't fade. This isn’t just about projects — it’s about proving that someone like me can build the future."
